#Machine Learning with Energy Datasets

## Introduction:
As interest in IOT and sensors pick up steam, companies are trying to build algorithms and systems to understand consumer behavior to help them make better decisions. One such application is energy modeling. Though, most consumers are aware of their aggregate consumption of energy, few are aware of how and where energy is consumed. With increasing sensors in equipment, it is becoming easier to find out which equipment/instruments consume the most power. AdaptiveAlgo Systems Inc. works on solutions to build algorithms and platforms to address energy modeling challenges. The company is putting together a solution for energy modeling and is interested in understanding consumer energy usage and the attributes that contribute to appliance energy usage. The data scientists there came across a recent paper and dataset and are interested in building various machine learning models that could contribute to understanding energy usage by appliances and the attributes that contribute to aggregate energy usage. With the knowledge of energy consumed by various equipment, seasonality and attributes like temperature and humidity, a machine learning model could be used to predict aggregate energy use.
